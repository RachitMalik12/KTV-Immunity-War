-Advanced Vertex/Geometry Shader (BZ): All effects are added using vertex shaders. Added shop items bouncing effect for flavour. Added player and enemy hit shaking effect. Added enemy knock back effect that work for both sword and waterball. Added death animation for enemies getting cut in half by sword. This was done by adding two more vertices which separated the two triangles in the quad so we can animate them getting separated. Added enemy death animation shrink. This was done by separating the scale matrix from the transform matrix and creating a new scale matrix in the vertex shader. Added player animation flopping to the side. This was done by separating the rotation matrix from the transform matrix and forming a new rotation matrix in the vertex shader.
